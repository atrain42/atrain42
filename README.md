### Hi there üëã 
I am a self-taught developer who has a passion for software development. What I enjoy the most about software development, is the challenge and continuous learning within the industry. I have always loved art and technology, and I find that frontend development is the perfect combination of both.

### What am I currently doing? ‚ö°Ô∏è
- Learning Next.js and how to pass data from the server to the client
- Improving my React.js skills and diving deeper into more advanced concepts
- Learning Tailwind.css in order to write CSS more efficiently
- Learning best practices to increase web performance


### My current Frontend tech stack includes:
