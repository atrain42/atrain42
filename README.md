### Hi there 👋 
I am a self-taught developer who has a passion for software development. What I enjoy the most about software development, is the challenge and continuous learning within the industry. I have always loved art and technology, and I find that frontend development is the perfect combination of both.

### What am I currently doing? ⚡️
- Working as a Frontend Developer at Advisory Alpha
- Learning Ruby on Rails
- Learning best practices to increase web performance
- Advancing my design skills by learning Adobe Illustrator and Figma


### My current Frontend tech stack includes:
