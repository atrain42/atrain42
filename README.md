### Hi there ü´µ

I have always loved art and technology, and I find that frontend development is the perfect combination of both.

### What am I currently doing? üòÄ
- Working as a Frontend Developer at Advisory Alpha
- Learning best practices to increase web performance
- Advancing my design skills by learning Adobe Illustrator and Figma
