### Hi there üëã 
I am a frontend developer who has a passion for all areas of software development. What I enjoy the most about software development, is the challenge and continuous learning within the industry. I have always loved art and technology, and I find that frontend development is the perfect combination of both.

- Working as a Frontend Developer at Advisory Alpha
- Learning best practices to increase web performance
